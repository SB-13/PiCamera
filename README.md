# PiCamera
Setting up the Raspberry Pi Camera and the HTML + JS to use it. 

Follow the steps at 

http://www.sitepoint.com/streaming-a-raspberry-pi-camera-into-vr-with-javascript/ 

to setup the raspberry pi camera. Only go up to where is says "Accessing Camera Images Via Javascript" as that is not what we do and the javascript for showing the camera stream has already been committed along with the associated HTML.
